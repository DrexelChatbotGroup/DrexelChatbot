Some of the important rules that I am copying from the Python code sytle guide.
Full guide: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

If anyone has any other rules they would like to add, please do and then tell everyone



Naming conventions: 
Package names (folder names) should be all lowercase 

Module names (file names) should be all lowercase, with underscores if need be

Class names should use CapWords (camel case)

Variables should use CapWords and short names

Function names should be all lowercase, with underscores if need be



Visibility:
Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance variables.
(not really private though, its just convention)

If your class is intended to be subclassed, and you have attributes that you 
do not want subclasses to use, consider naming them with double leading 
underscores and no trailing underscores. 

Modules should explicitly declare the names in their public API using the __all__ attribute



Blank lines:
Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.

Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related 
functions. Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners 
(e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.


Doc Strings:
Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods. 

Docstrings are not necessary for non-public methods, but you should have a comment 
that describes what the method does. This comment should appear after the def line.

<Example>
"""Return a foobang

Optional plotz says to frobnicate the bizbaz first.
"""
</Example>



Top of a file:
You should have a doc string that explains the module, then set some "dunders", then do imports

<Example>
"""This is the example module.

This module does stuff.
"""

__all__ = ['a', 'b', 'c']
__version__ = '0.1'
__author__ = 'Cardinal Biggles'

import os
import sys
</Example>



Misc:
Spaces perferred over tabs for indentation

Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), 
the line length should be limited to 72 characters.
