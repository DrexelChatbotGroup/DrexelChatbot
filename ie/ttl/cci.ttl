Deng came to Drexel in September 2016 after a seven-year tenure as dean of the College of Computing and Informatics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where his leadership helped to transform the college leading to dramatic growth in academic programming, enrollment, and research funding. His leadership also helped to shape the university’s direction and priorities, and to establish the college as a powerhouse in the region’s economic development efforts. Prior to his post at UNC Charlotte, Deng served as professor and dean at the School of Computing and Information Sciences at Florida International University (FIU). During his tenure at UNC Charlotte, the College of Computing and Informatics launched six new interdisciplinary bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degree programs and established an international educational partnership with China. The College saw its undergraduate enrollment double to 1,480 and its graduate enrollment increase by 140 percent to 870 students — making UNC Charlotte one of the largest computing and informatics programs in the nation. Under Deng’s leadership, the College’s annual extramural research funding nearly tripled to $14.8 million. This was accompanied by improvements in research quality, productivity and a sustained increase in the doctoral graduation rate. He also led the development of overarching industry and community partnerships and established the College as a pillar in the region for talent, innovation and economic development. Part of Deng’s success as a leader comes from his time as a researcher and teacher. He authored or co-authored more than 100 research papers in peer-reviewed journals and proceedings and was awarded more than $21 million in research funding as a principal or co-principal investigator. Deng has initiated, led and managed many research projects in areas of software engineering, modeling and design, as well as large scale interdisciplinary research & education projects and their applications in healthcare, cyberinfrastructure, disaster management, and other areas. Deng founded or directed several major research centers or partnerships, including the Latin American (LA Grid) Consortium, the Consortium of Partnership for International Research and Education (PIRE) — whose partners include leading institutions and research centers in the United States, Mexico, Argentina, Spain, France, China, India and Japan. He is a leader in implementing large-scale diversity initiatives with sustained organizational changes. At FIU, he established the School of Computing and Information Sciences as a national leader for educating under-represented minorities in computing at all levels. He spearheaded and led an ambitious Women-in-Computing initiative at UNC Charlotte to improve gender balance in IT at the national scale. Deng received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh and a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science & Technology from the University of Science and Technology of China." .

Her studies employ grounded theory, ethnography, and qualitative/mixed methods to investigate domains including Enterprise System design, distributed virtual organizations, peer- and vicarious learning in online education, and research networks of practice. She explores three “big questions”: How can we co-design the processual and technical aspects of information systems to support organizational adaptation, peer-learning, and effective collaboration? Understanding how to manage distributed cognition is critical for boundary-spanning design, which involves wicked problems that span knowledge domain and expertise boundaries. How is knowledge created, communicated, and shared in distributed, virtual collaboration environments? Increasingly, non-human objects mediate human relationships, as these progressively displace people in distributed knowledge networks. We may be able to identify forms of metaknowledge that work across domain boundaries by identifying mediating object roles, e.g. categorization schemes, databases, technology, or routinized practices that embed frameworks for analysis or participation. How can we ensure that technology design is human-centered? Creating new design methods and approaches is only part of the assemblage of professional design practice. The impact of technology platforms for design collaboration, the ways in which methods are implemented, and the approaches used to stakeholder requirements elicitation are all important constraints on human-centered design outcomes. Dr. Gasson is interested in advising doctoral students interested in distributed cognition, knowledge processes and technologies, and post-social theory, that attempts to theorize the role of (material, epistemic, technical, symbolic, mediating) objects in networks of practice. Current (and recent) dissertation students work, for example, on distributed knowledge networks in archaeology research, organization and leadership in technology-mediated FOSS projects, and user involvement in distributed FOSS design, processes. These students use an ethnographic approach to better understand the theoretical and cultural construction and the various dimensions of the respective domains." .

Mainland's research focuses on high-level programming language and runtime support for non-general purpose computation. His work seeks to make it easier to exploit the power of special-purpose devices, like GPUs, that require specialized programming models for optimal efficiency. After obtaining an bachelor of arts degree in physics from Harvard, Mainland spent three years working in Silicon Valley. He then returned to Harvard, where he completed his doctorate in computer science in 2011. He was also a postdoctoral researcher with the Programming Principles and Tools group at Microsoft Research Cambridge (UK). Mainland's research interests span both the systems and programming languages communities. He has published papers at conferences such as Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI) and the International Conference on Functional programming (ICFP)." .

His research and teaching interests center around data science, computational social science, natural language processing, mathematics, machine learning, scientific programming, and algorithms design. His published contributions to date have yielded a scalable framework for the extraction of generalized lexical units (phrases), which has opened the field of phrase-based text analysis, and led to the development of a current state-of-the-art algorithm for multiword expressions segmentation. His work has also successfully challenged the current major statistical theory of language production, dating back over 15 years. In addition to extending his work in linguistics and natural language processing, a large component of his current research is applied to social science, and is focused on understanding collective action and political events through social media. He has taught a number of courses in undergraduate mathematics, and graduate coursework in scalable machine learning. His current teaching focus is on the development of curricula in undergraduate data science and scientific programming." .
