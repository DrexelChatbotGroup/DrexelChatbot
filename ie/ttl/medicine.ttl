Watching a loved one suffer inspired May to pursue a medical career. She attended the United Nations International School in New York City, where she learned English as a second language and Spanish as a third. She graduated valedictorian of her class and attended Princeton University, graduating magna cum laude. True to her dream of becoming a doctor, she completed her medical studies at the University of Pennsylvania, remaining there for her internship and residency in internal medicine. Dr. May serves as the medical director of the flagship internal medicine practice here at Drexel University College of Medicine. She maintains a busy practice where she sees patients every day. Dr. May prides herself on delivering excellent care to her patients while practicing preventive, evidenced-based medicine. Although she has lost her accent, Dr. May remains fluent in French and English. She is able to converse in Spanish and Creole. Dr. May is married with two young and very active boys, ages 14 and 12. In her spare time, you will find her spending time with her boys. She spends many rewarding hours watching them play sports or on their musical instruments.

    cb:interests "Visit the Osei-Owusu Lab Our long-standing interest is to elucidate mechanisms by which G-protein signaling regulation plays a role in physiological and pathophysiological adaptations of the cardiovascular and renal systems. Abnormal G-protein signaling contributes to the development and establishment of diseases of the cardiovascular and renal systems, including hypertension, chronic kidney diseases, heart failure, diabetes, and stroke. Accordingly, receptors that activate G-protein signaling pathways remain predominant therapeutic targets of cardiovascular and renal disease medications, including angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. However, current therapies are inadequate as morbidity and mortality of these diseases continue to rise worldwide. The specific focus of research in our laboratory is to unravel novel mechanisms whereby regulation and dysregulation of G-protein signaling by regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins are involved in normal functions and diseases of the cardiovascular and renal systems. To this end, we employ an integrative physiology approach, including the use of small animal disease models, mouse genetics (knock-outs, knock-ins, transgenics, and humanized mice), telemetric blood pressure and heart rate recordings, sympathetic nerve recordings, laser-Doppler flowmetry, ex-vivo studies of the microcirculation, molecular and cellular biology, whole organ and single-cell calcium imaging, and confocal video microscopy. Our ultimate goal is to gain more insight into the underlying causes of cardiovascular and renal diseases, which may lead to the identification of novel targets for developing new and more effective therapeutics." .
